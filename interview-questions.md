# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: parameter is a variable in a function. The argument is the data that its asking for.

Researched answer: A parameter is a named variable found in functions and methods. An argument has its contents exported to parameter variables in functions and methods.

Researched answer:The .map() method takes 3 parameters: element, index, and array. Only a value is required, the other 2 are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: both are arrays but map will return array and the filter will filter out specific values you give.

Researched answer: Both functions are higher-order functions, but map will return the same array, transformed based on an input, meaning it will always be the same size. Filter will filter out values of the array that do not meet a determined criteria, and so will not always return the same size array, but a new one with only the filtered results.
