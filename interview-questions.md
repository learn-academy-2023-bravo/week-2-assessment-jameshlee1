# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is the input that is required by the function. Think of a parameter as a placeholder for the data being passed into the function, while the argument is the actual data that gets passed into the function. A parameter is what goes into the function while the argument is the data that you call the function with.

Researched answer: Parameters are variables that will be passed to the function for processing. Arguments are values passed into the function when it is invoked.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .map() takes in the index, the value, and the array used with the higher order function. The value is required while the index and the array are optional.

Researched answer: The built in method .map() has three built in parameters. Because .map is only used when working with arrays, the three parameters are the value of the array, the index of the array, and the array that the higher order function was called on. The array, and the index of the array at its current iteration are optional. The value of the array at its current iteration is always required.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: map will change each item in the array usually through iteration and return an array of the same size. filter will filter through the array and keep what we do want and get rid of what we dont want.

Researched answer: .map will modify each item in an array and return an array of the SAME size. filter will look at each item in the array and return a subset of the original array.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is repeating an action a certain number of times until a condition is met.

Researched answer: Iteration is the process of performing actions a certain number of times or until a condition is met.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Component: A component is everything in react. There are components that hold state and there are components that do not hold state.

2. Spread operator: The spread operator is ... it lets us copy an array into another array, or an object into another object.

3. React state: State is a variable that determines the behavior of the component. State stores data.

4. React props: Short for properties, these give us the ability to communicate between components by passing data from one component to a nested component.

5. DOM events: These are ways in which the user can interact with the web page, such as clicking, hovering with the mouse, or typing.
